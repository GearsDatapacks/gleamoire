version: 1.2.1
title: Should report unknown package on hex

InterfaceError: Package impossibly_impossible_name_to_guess does not exist.

If you are documenting a module inside a package with a different name,
try specifying the package name explicitly: `package:module/wibble.item`

If the package does exist, but was published before Gleam v1.0.0, it will not
contain a package-interface.json file and cannot be documented.
